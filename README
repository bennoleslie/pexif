pexif is a Python library for  parsing and more importantly 
editing EXIF data in JPEG files.

This grew out of a need to add GPS tagged data to my images,
Unfortunately the other libraries out there couldn't do updates and
didn't seem easily architectured to be able to add such a thing. Ain't
reusable software grand!

Apps:
 dump_exif.py: Output the EXIF file from a given file.
 setgps.py: Set the GPS metadata on a file.
 getgps.py: Get the GPS metadata from a file.
 noop.py: This is a no-op on a jpeg file. Useful for testing images are 
          preserved across operations using pexif. Note that the binary data
          will not be exact as pexif will compress unused space in the file, 
          however running it on a file twice should end up with the same data.

Examples:
 hello.py: Add a simple description to a photo.

Status:
 WARNING: This could destroy your images!! Backup your images before using.
 
 Currently it parses files from my Canon without a problem, and is able
 to add a GPS tag without corrupting the rest of the image.

 This work couldn't be done with the reference for the spec. In
 particular I worked to:

 used for testing FUJIFILM exif data.

 Nick Burch <nick@gagravarr.org> provided noexif.jpg which is used 
 for testing inputs that don't have an existing EXIF segment. Nick
 burch also found an error in GeoTags on the S60.

 my examples to show how copying EXIF data from one jpeg to another.

 the GeoTag functionality.

 Marcell Lengyel <miketkf@gmail.com> for adding better support for 
 Canon g3 and FujiFilm z5fd.

 extended IFD sections, and supplying the timezone adjustment script.
